    <h3>A Breif introduction of my work</h3>
    <p>With the current development in computer science and technologies, I thought to myself, why not stay updated with the technolgy and why not upskill myself.
      I decided to start learning web development and give a start to my coding skills.
      now I have learnt building multipage websites and linking the pages.
      I am greatly excited and very enthusiastic about moving on to styling and advance web development. <br />
    
      By the time you'll be reading this, I will have become a full fledged web developer. <br />

      I hope you liked this work. I would love facing more challenges and take up more projects.
      See you soon on my other projects.
